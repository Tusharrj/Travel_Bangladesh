	<h1>Inani Beach </h1>
	<hr>
</div>
	
    <p>Inani Beach is a golden sea beach located off the coasts of Bangladesh. Although alone it is 11 miles (18 kilometers) in length, Inani Beach is actually just one part of the much larger Cox's Bazar, which at 75 miles (120 km) ranks among the absolute longest beaches on the planet. It is also among the world's broadest beaches, at 197 yards (180 meters) during high tide and 328 yards (300 m) at low tide. Though Inani Beach is located by the town of Cox's Bazar, visitors must hire an Auto Rickshaw in order to actually reach the beach as it is located in a secluded area. For many, however, this exclusivity only adds to the beach's appeal, as its golden sands and beautiful clear waters attract many tourists looking for a relaxing escape. As in the rest of Bangladesh, temperatures remain quite high throughout most of the year, reaching up to 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit (34.8 degrees Celsius). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Many tourists come to visit this beach every year to relax and enjoy its nature. The best place to stay is in the nearby town of Cox's Bazar, which is about 13 miles away from the beach. Since there are no stores or restaurants in the vicinity, visitors should bring food and any other amenities that they will need with them. Tourists can even get a tour of the beach in a jeep due to its long length. The town of Cox's Bazar is 94 miles south of Chittagong, which travelers can reach easily via plane or bus. Inani Beach is unique because it has not yet been turned into a tourist trap with hotels and chain restaurants surrounding it. Indeed, as international tourism to Bangladesh has not yet been popularized, visitors traveling to Inani Beach are more likely to be surrounded by nature and can use this beach as a relaxing escape from their busy lives. The beach is famous for its rock and coral boulders as well as the lush, green hills behind it. Since there are many boulders, however, the beach is not suitable for surfing. Most visitors recommend watching the sunrise or sunset at the beach to see the sky and sea meet, which proves to be an unforgettable sight.
