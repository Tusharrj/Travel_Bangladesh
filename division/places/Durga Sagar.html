    <p>Durga Sagar is the largest pond or dighi of southern Bangladesh, with an area of about 2,500 hectare. It is located at Madhabpasa village of Babuganj Upazila, about 11 km away from Barisal town. Locally it is known as Madhabpasha Dighi. Initially there were four brick built ghats each having 15 m width. Due to the lack of proper maintenance jungles gradually surrounded the dighi.However in 1975, government renovated it to some extent. There is a forested hill in the lake, which is like a small island. There are coconut trees around the dighi which together with the dighi are bounded by brick-walls. There are two gates each on the eastern and western sides of Durga Sagar. In the middle of the dighi, there is an island with bushes.

    The pond Durga Shagor Dighi can also be written as Durgasagor Dighi. It is a massive pond that was dug during 1780 by Rani Durgaboti who was the mother of Raja Joynarayan. The initiative was taken to ease the water crisis of the local people. That time it had four ghat at the four sides of the Dighi. Later those got ruined and covered with jungle. This large water tank is named after that magnanimous Rani Durgaboti .Later in 1975, the Dighi was restored and these days only two ghat available at the north and west side. Now a days, the area is totally bounded by the walls. It has a footpath around for the pedestrian. It requires to pay 10 Taka to enter inside the premise. You can have a swim at the massive pond if you have extra cloth with you. They have a facility for fishing on there. You just need to pay the amount to get the permission.
